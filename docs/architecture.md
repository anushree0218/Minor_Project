# Vision-Based Navigation System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of a vision-based navigation system with dynamic prioritization, uncertainty quantification, and fallback mechanisms. The system processes image inputs through multiple stages to produce reliable navigation guidance.

## System Components

### Input Processing
- **Image Input**: Raw visual data captured from cameras
- **Feature Extraction**: Converts image data into feature representations suitable for downstream processing

### Priority Management
- **Dynamic Priority Module**: Analyzes visual input and assigns processing priorities
  - **High Priority**: Navigation elements (traffic signs, lane markings, obstacles)
  - **Medium Priority**: Landmarks and reference points
  - **Low Priority**: General scene elements and context

### Processing Pipeline
- **Segmentation Networks**: Process prioritized elements for semantic understanding
- **Temporal Consistency Module**: Ensures output stability across frames by integrating:
  - **HD Map Data**: High-definition map information
  - **Previous Frames**: Historical processing results

### Decision Making
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Evaluates confidence in detected elements
  - **High Certainty Regions**: Areas with reliable detection
  - **Uncertain Regions**: Areas requiring additional verification
- **Navigation Decision Engine**: Makes decisions based on high-confidence data
- **Fallback Systems**: Alternative processes when primary detection is uncertain

### Output Generation
- **Path Planning**: Determines optimal route based on decision engine output
- **Navigation Guidance**: Final instructions for navigation

### Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback Loop**: Routes system performance metrics back to improve feature extraction

## System Flow
1. Camera captures image data
2. Feature extraction processes raw images
3. Dynamic priority module assigns processing importance
4. Segmentation networks process elements according to priority
5. Temporal consistency module integrates current with historical data
6. Uncertainty quantification evaluates detection confidence
7. Navigation decisions route through main engine or fallback systems
8. Path planning integrates all available information
9. Navigation guidance is generated
10. Feedback is captured to improve future processing

## Advantages
- Prioritization ensures critical navigation elements receive processing focus
- Uncertainty quantification improves system safety
- Fallback mechanisms provide redundancy
- Temporal consistency reduces frame-to-frame instability
- Feedback loop enables continuous system improvement
